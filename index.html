            <h2>Special Session on Embodied Intelligence Systems</h2>
            <p>Overview and Scope</p>
            <p>As intelligent agents become increasingly embedded in physical environments, including autonomous vehicles, service robots, and industrial IoT systems, real-time embodied intelligence has emerged as a key research domain. These systems must continuously perceive their environment, process information under strict timing constraints, and coordinate with other agents to execute complex tasks in a collaborative and responsive manner. This special session focuses on embodied intelligent systems and multi agent real-time collaboration. It aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on low latency perception, deterministic transmission, time aware decision making, and cooperative execution frameworks.</p>
            <p>Topics of relevance for the special session papers include but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time perception and multi-modal sensing</li>
                <li>Lightweight embedded frameworks for time-critical computation</li>
                <li>Response time analysis and system-level timing guarantees</li>
                <li>Scheduling and task orchestration in embedded intelligent systems</li>
                <li>Communication latency and timing-aware protocols</li>
                <li>Data fusion under constrained resources and deadlines</li>
                <li>Scheduling and coordination in distributed systems</li>
                <li>Multi-agent collaboration with timing requirements</li>
            </ul>
