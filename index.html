        <h2>Special Session on Embodied Intelligence Systems</h2>
        <h4>Overview and Scope</h4>
        <p>As intelligent agents become increasingly embedded in physical environments, including autonomous vehicles, service robots, and industrial IoT systems, real-time embodied intelligence has emerged as a key research domain. These systems must continuously perceive their environment, process information under strict timing constraints, and coordinate with other agents to execute complex tasks in a collaborative and responsive manner. This special session will be held in Xian, Shanxi, China, November 8-9, 2025 as a session of 31st IEEE/ACIS International Summer Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD 2025). This special session focuses on embodied intelligent systems and multi agent real-time collaboration. It aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on low latency perception, deterministic transmission, time aware decision making, and cooperative execution frameworks.</p>
        <h4>Topics of relevance for the special session papers include but not limited to:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Real-time perception and multi-modal sensing</li>
            <li>Lightweight embedded frameworks for time-critical computation</li>
            <li>Response time analysis and system-level timing guarantees</li>
            <li>Scheduling and task orchestration in embedded intelligent systems</li>
            <li>Communication latency and timing-aware protocols</li>
            <li>Data fusion under constrained resources and deadlines</li>
            <li>Scheduling and coordination in distributed systems</li>
            <li>Multi-agent collaboration with timing requirements</li>
        </ul>
